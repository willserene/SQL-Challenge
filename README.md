# SQL-Challenge
-----------------------
Fun and instructive challenge starting out with a quick exercise to sketch out an ERD, followed by engineering the associated table schemata and performing queries to generate and analyze lists utilizing pgAmin and a PostgreSQL database. 

This repository contains the CSV files used to create the database along with a folder labeled "EmployeeSQL" that houses an image of the ERD sketch and the associated source along with SQL files housing the table schemata and queries.
